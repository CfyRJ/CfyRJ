I graduated from St. Petersburg Polytechnic University with a degree in design engineer.

Now Iâ€™m finishing my profession as a Python developer using a hexlet. Previously, I studied python in the courses of [Sergei Balakirev](https://stepik.org/users/345061624/profile) using a stepik.

In my work, I often decomposed tasks. I love solving logic problems. Now I continue to master the heights of Python, flask, HTTP, Django. I'm working on new projects using these technologies.
